# # Linear Regression Project 1
# 
#  Ecommerce company  that sells clothing online. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.
# 
# The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website. 

# 1) Imports

# In[34]:


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# 2)Get the Data
# 
# 

# In[35]:


customers = pd.read_csv("Ecommerce Customers")


# 3) Explore data frame (head, info, stat)

# In[36]:


customers.head()


# In[37]:


customers.info()


# In[38]:


customers.describe()


# In[39]:


customers.columns


# 4) Exploratory Data Analysis
# Use seaborn to create a jointplot to compare the Time on Website and Yearly Amount Spent columns. 
# Does the correlation make sense?

# In[40]:


sns.jointplot(data=customers, x="Time on Website", y="Yearly Amount Spent")


# #Do the same but with the Time on App column 

# In[41]:


sns.jointplot(data=customers, x="Time on App", y="Yearly Amount Spent")


# ##Use jointplot to create a 2D hex bin plot comparing Time on App and Length of Membership.##

# In[42]:


sns.jointplot(x="Time on App", y="Length of Membership", kind="hex", data=customers)


# ##Explore  relationships across the entire data set. Use [pairplot](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/axis_grids.html#plotting-pairwise-relationships-with-pairgrid-and-pairplot) to recreate the plot below.##

# In[43]:


sns.pairplot(customers)


# In[ ]:


**Based off this plot what looks to be the most correlated feature with Yearly Amount Spent?**


# Based on above plot what looks to be the most corelated feature with yearly Amount Spent?
# Answer: Length of Membership

# ##Create a linear model plot (using seaborn's lmplot) of  Yearly Amount Spent vs. Length of Membership. ##

# In[45]:


sns.lmplot(x="Length of Membership", y="Yearly Amount Spent", data= customers)


# 5)Training and Testing Data: split the data into training and testing sets.
#  Set a variable x = numerical features of the customers and a variable y = "Yearly Amount Spent" column. 

# In[46]:


customers.columns


# In[47]:


y = customers["Yearly Amount Spent"]
x = customers[['Avg. Session Length', 'Time on App', 'Time on Website', 'Length of Membership']]


# ##Use model_selection.train_test_split from sklearn to split the data into training and testing sets.
# Set test_size=0.3 and random_state=101##

# In[48]:


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split


# In[49]:


x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(x, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=101)


# 6) Training the Model
# Import LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model 

# In[50]:


from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression


# ##Create an function of a LinearRegression() model named lm

# In[51]:


lm = LinearRegression()


# ** Train/fit lm on the training data.**

# In[52]:


lm.fit(x_train, y_train)


# **Print out the coefficients of the model**

# In[53]:


lm.coef_


# 7) Predicting Test Data
# Now that we have fit our model, let's evaluate its performance by predicting off the test values!
# 
# Use lm.predict() to predict off the X_test set of the data.

# In[54]:


predictions = lm.predict(x_test)


# In[60]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')


# ** Create a scatterplot of the real test values versus the predicted values. **

# In[67]:


plt.scatter(y_test, predictions)
plt.xlabel("y Test(True Values)")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Values")


# 8) Evaluating the Model
# 
# Let's evaluate our model performance by calculating the residual sum of squares and the explained variance score (R^2).
# 
# ##Calculate the Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and the Root Mean Squared Error.## 
# 

# In[68]:


from sklearn import metrics


# In[70]:


print("MAE", metrics.mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions))
print("MSE", metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions))
print("RMSE", np.sqrt(metrics.mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions)))


# In[78]:


metrics.explained_variance_score(y_test, predictions)# gives R^2 value


# 8) Residuals
# 
# So far we have good model with a good fit.
# Explore the residuals ( difference between real data and predictions) to make sure everything was okay with our data. 
# 
# ##Plot a histogram of the residuals and make sure it looks normally distributed. Use either seaborn distplot,
# or just plt.hist()##

# In[80]:


sns.distplot((y_test - predictions), bins=50) # distribution of y_test - predictions


# 9) Conclusion: Mobile app Vs Website
# 
# ##Recreate the dataframe below. ##

# In[84]:


cdf = pd.DataFrame(lm.coef_ , x.columns, columns=["Coeff"])
cdf


# Interpretion of above coefficients: For example if we hold all the parameters fixed and 
#     increase Avg.Session length by one unit then that means there is an incremnet of price of
#     Avg Session Length by $26

# What do you think company should focus on  mobile app or Website ?
# You should discuss the above results with management team to get more insight on financial of each parameters.

# Happy Coding !!!
